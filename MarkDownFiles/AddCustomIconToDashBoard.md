Chose the layer from your map that has the integer data you want to display such as turtle observation count.

Once the layer you want to use is picked, go into the "Data" tab of the indicator. Once within that tab, pick the field you want to grab the data from. This sould show you the number count of the field you are displaying.

### Step 3
To make a custom icon display within your indicator, go into the "Indicator" tab just under the "Data" tab. In this tab you can pick the location of text displayed and at the bottom you can click on "Add Icon"
At the bottom of the options there is a "Custom" tab, inside it will ask you to paste in the SVG code of your custom icon.
