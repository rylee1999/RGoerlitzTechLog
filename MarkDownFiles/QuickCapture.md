## Quick How To

### Step 1: Having a pre-made feature layer
You can start by either adding a pre saved map or feature later from your AGOL account or create a new one for this project.
There are two choices given to create your buttons and they are either using the fields from the feature layer or to create your own bu link to a web map.

If you use a feature layer, the app will create buttons of all your fields grouped by layers.

### Step 2: Using a web map and creating your own buttons
The app allows you to add labels which can be grouped together, these labels can then be cutomized with colour and icons. 
To add new labels or new groups of labels use the top organce icon ( 3 symbols inside) to drag and drop to get desired placement or order.
