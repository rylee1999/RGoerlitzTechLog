# Learning about ArcGIS Instant Apps 

**** It took a long time to configure, had to refresh page to get it to work ****

This app allows uses to enter in data on a map, this could be helpful for our Citiizen Science Turtle Monitoring project, a app can also be used with a web application, up to the user. 

*** To edit after publishing you do not click edit like story map, it is called "Configure" ****

## HINT : while chosing a app best suited for your project make sure you are checking for errors at the top of app option, some apps are not suitbale for all data layers or map types.

## Testing the Reporter App (Beta) 

### Step 1
You can link a map you have already created in AGOL, I used the map linked to myTurtle Demo 123 Survey. THIS CAN LIVE UPDATE VIA APP and WEB APPLICATION, COOL!
While in the map options you can pick the extent the map will display as in app. You can also see how it looks on a phone which is important since this will ba  a phone app. To see this you need to go 
to the "View" tab on the left side of app configuration layout.

### Step 2 
You can add a header, introductory text and alternative text for map. The introductory text is the first thing that shows up when the user opens the app. This is a googd place to rely some information 
about the app to the user.

### Step 3
You can customize the pop-ups that are sent to the user after they have entered a report such as a turtle sighting, such as "Thank you! Your report was successfully submitted".  You can also customize the button that the user is clicking to reports something, for example "Report a Turtle Sighting".

### Step 4
You also have the option to customize the map layout such as adding a legend and moving map items around on the map. The apps header can also be customized.
