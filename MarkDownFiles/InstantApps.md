# Learning about ArcGIS Instant Apps: Testing the Reporter App (Beta) 

**** It took a long time to configure, had to refresh page to get it to work ****
This app allows uses to enter in data on a map, this could be helpful for our Citiizen Science Turtle Monitoring project, a app can also be installed in top of a web application. 
*** To edit after publishing you do not click edit like story map, it is called "Configure" 

### Step 1
You can link a map you have already created in AGOL, I used the map linked to myTurtle Demo 123 Survey. THIS CAN LIVE UPDATE VIA APP and WEB APPLICATION, COOL!
While in the map options you can pick the extent the map will display as in app. You can also see how it looks on a phone which is important since this will ba  a phone app. To see this you need to go 
to the "View" tab on the left side of app configuration layout.

### Step 2 
You can add a header, introductory text and alternative text for map. The introductory text is the first thing that shows up when the user opens the app. This is a googd place to rely some information 
about the app to the user.
