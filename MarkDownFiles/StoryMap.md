# Tips and Tricks For Story Map

### There are three different types of "side car" layouts that can be used to create an interactive experience with information both written and visual. These include:
Docked --> text will appear on either side of the layout on a media scroll that slides down, each section of the media scroll can have its own image/map/emmbed. This is good to display different maps 
with text descriptions.
Floating --> Simialar to docked, but the media scroll doe not take one side of the layout up but floats over a image/map that takes up entire side car slide. Good at displaying maps as the main view
with some information added.
Slideshow --> This acts like a slideshow, images/maps move right to left with the option of a media tag to add text to.
