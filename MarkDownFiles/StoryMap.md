# Tips and Tricks For Story Map

### There are three different types of "side car" layouts that can be used to create an interactive experience with information both written and visual. These include:
### Docked 
Text will appear on either side of the layout on a media scroll that slides down, each section of the media scroll can have its own image/map/emmbed. This is good to display different maps 
with text descriptions.
### Floating
Simialar to docked, but the media scroll doe not take one side of the layout up but floats over a image/map that takes up entire side car slide. Good at displaying maps as the main view
with some information added.
### Slideshow
This acts like a slideshow, images/maps move right to left with the option of a media tag to add text to. 

# Design Tool Options 
### Credits and Navigation Options
Inisde the design tab you can turn on credits at the bottom of the story map and naviagtion tabs. Navigation tabs can act like different chapters of the story map, which display at the top of the 
Story Map that follows you as you move through the story. **Important to know that all Headings within the story are what becomes the navigation chapters, these can be turned on and off.

# Map Appearances 
### Legend and Overview Map
In the options available for embeded maps in your story map include adding a search menu and current location to your map. There is also a legend option to dock the legend or make it vivsble while hovering over the map. There is also a cool option of a "Overview Map" this is a globe that shows the location of your maps study area. *** Important to note is that you cannot edit the cartography of the embedded map in story map, you need to go into the layer icon and click on "edit in AGOL". You can only edit in AGOL, thus make changes first before adding to story map.

# Express Maps 
### Draw your own map within story map
Express map is an map option that becomes available when you go to add a map from your AGOL account, it shows up as "New Express Map". This is a really cool option to show a study area or number different locations of a map. You can also change the base map used, BUT the scaling is werid so make sure to play around with the sizing.
