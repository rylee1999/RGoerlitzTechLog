# Add 123 Survey forum/ web map to Dashboard 

### Step 1
Create a forum in 123 Survey and publish it. While in 123 Survey app, go to the the "Collaborate" tab at the top of page. Inside that tab make sure all sharing survey and results are open to 
the public if this is meant to be a web application.  Make sure to save all changes. 

### Step 2
Then go into your AGOL account and find the new survey folder (this has the survey you just created) within your contents tab. Make sure to not delete this in AGOL by mistake since the survey 
will be gone!

Go into the folder contianing your new survey, inside there should be the fourm and 3 feature layers. Click onto the "Feature Layer (hosted) item detail via the 3 dots beside "View Details".
Add metadata for the feature layer (summary, description, thumbnail)

### Step 3
Once in the item details, open the layer with "Open in Map Viewer". Since you have not added any data yet via the 123 survey, go back to the "Collaborate" tab in the 123 Survey app. Grab the URL link 
at the top within the "Share Survey" side tab on the left side of the screen. This link will bring your browser to the survey to complete and add data.

Once you have added your data go back to the Map Viewer and save map and share it publically.

### Step 4 
Then go into Dashborads and make a new one, once in the new dashboard go to add element buttom (plus sign on left scroll tab). Then go and add map, this will add the map connected to the survey. 
meaning that everytime someone submits to the survey it is added to the map and dashboard. Remember to save dashbaord before closing !
